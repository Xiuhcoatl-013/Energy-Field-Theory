    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every motor drive inverter in the market rely on Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) to synthesize the output current waveform. Because of that, the actual instantaneous voltage waveform at the inverter terminals will consist of very steep flanks at the beginning and end of each pulse. This is the origin for a multitude of negative effects on the connected equipment.\n",

    "### Background\n",
    "When a PWM inverter is running, it will create a series of voltage pulses with the same amplitude, but different length and separation at the output terminals. Every time a new pulse is created, the rising edge of that voltage pulse will propagate through the cable towards the far end, i.e. to the connected equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the steepness of this pulse together with the impedance difference between the cable and load, the voltage seen at the cable end might be twice the voltage sent from the inverter. This is caused by the reflective wave phenomenon which is very common in fast switching applications and is extensively investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its effect on equipment and motor windings in particular was discovered in the early 1990s, when inverter manufacturers seized using voltage sine wave filters at the inverter output because the current was made sinusoidal by the inductance in the machine windings alone. As a result of this, stator windings started to fail prematurely and efforts were put to discover why."

    "If the time required by the voltage pulse to reach the motor is more than $1 / 3$ of the voltage rise time ùë°ùëü, the pulse will reflect back to the source (e.g. the inverter output terminals). This reflection is maximized when the speed of the propagating pulse is $c / 2$, i.e. half the speed of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "The propagation speed is dependent on the network of parasitic elements which the cable is built up by: an infinite amount of ùúã-equivalents in series i.e. inductors in series with a capacitive coupling to earth between each of them. The voltage pulse will charge these capacitances in turn before reaching the connected equipment. Thus the propagation velocity $ùë£$ is given by\n",

Thus the returning voltage pulse of 1 p.u. will add to the already existing 1 p.u. yielding a total terminal voltage of 2 p.u.\n",

    "## How would Modern Power Converters Improve Energy Efficiency of Grids\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Power electronics applications have been expanded vastly and widely in different electrical networks such as industrial, residential and commercial grids. The reason behind this vast expansion is the ability of power electronics techniques to reduce the cost, size and improve the performance of the appliances. The generated harmonics due to the use of power electronics converters reduce the efficiency and quality of power networks and causes stability issues. It has been witnessed that ac/dc converters are the main sources of harmonics. Thus, a proper and cost effective design of ac/dc converters to comply with harmonics international standards is required. Therefore, different harmonic mitigation strategies using active front-end have been proposed to tackle this issue. However, due to the cost effectiveness, simplicity, and reliability still conventional rectifiers such as diode rectifiers are recommended in different applications for a broad range of power electronics systems. Thus, a proper combination of single-phase and three-phase rectifiers can mutually cancel harmonics. However, in a single-phase rectifier, the conventional filter has been replaced by Power Factor Correction (PFC). Therefore, the nature of the phase angle variation of low order harmonics is not clearly discussed as it depends on many factors such as the penetration of single phase systems with PFC or passive filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this research, a comprehensive study of current harmonics behaviour in system level with high penetration of power converters will be conducted. Understanding harmonics‚Äô behaviour helps to propose new active and passive three-phase rectifiers with a function of grid harmonics filtering. Then, a comprehensive study about the effect of harmonics in system energy efficiency will be performed with a focus on the effect of harmonics order to transformers and cable losses. Finally, an optimization approach for grid harmonic mitigation will be proposed taking in account energy losses in network equipment as well as power quality issues."
