    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Imperfect switching is a major contributor to power loss in converters. Switching devices absorb power when they turn on or off if they go through a transition when both voltage and current are nonzero. As the switching frequency increases, these transitions occur more often and the average power loss in the device increases. High switching frequencies are otherwise\n",
    "desirable because of the reduced size of filter components and transformers, which reduces the size and weight of the converter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In resonant switching circuits, switching takes place when voltage and/or current is zero, thus avoiding simultaneous transitions of voltage and current and thereby eliminating switching losses. This type of switching is called soft\n",
    "switching, as opposed to hard switching in circuits such as the buck converter.\n",

    "Resonant converters include resonant switch converters, load resonant converters,and resonant dc link converters."

    "\n",
    "At resonance, the impedances of the inductance and capacitance cancel, and the load appears as a resistance. If the bridge output is a square wave at frequency $f_{0},$ the $L C$ combination acts as a filter, passing the fundamental frequency and attenuating the harmonics. If the third and higher harmonics of the square wave bridge output are effectively removed, the voltage across the load resistor is essentially a sinusoid at the square wave's fundamental frequency.\n",

    "The normalized frequency response with $Q$ as a parameter is shown in Fig. 3c. The total harmonic distortion THD, of the voltage across the load resistor is reduced by increasing the $Q$ of the filter. Increasing inductance and reducing capacitance increase $Q$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Switching Losses\n",
    "An important feature of the resonant inverter is that switch losses are reduced over that of the hard swithcing inverters discussed earlier. If switching is at the resonant frequency and the $Q$ of the circuit is high, the switches operate when the load current is at or near zero. This is significant because the power absorbed by the switches is less than in the nonresonant inverter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Amplitude Control\n",
    "If the frequency of the load voltage is not critical, the amplitude of the fundamental frequency across the load resistor can be controlled by shifting the switching frequency off of resonance. Power absorbed by the load resistor is thus controlled by the switching frequency. Induction heating is an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The switching frequency should be shifted higher than resonance rather than lower when controlling the output. Higher switching frequencies moves the harmonics of the square wave higher, increasing the filter's effectiveness in removing them. Conversely, shifting the frequency lower than resonance moves the harmonics, particularly the third harmonic, closer to resonance and increases their amplitudes in the output."

The output voltage is controlled by changing the switching frequency. The time interval when the switch is open is fixed, and the time interval when the switch is closed is varied. Times $t_{1}$ and $t_{3}$ are determined in part by the load current $I_{o}$, so output voltage is a function of load. Increasing the switching frequency decreases the time interval $T-t_{3}$ and thus reduces the output voltage. Normalized output voltage vs. switching frequency with the parameter $r=R_{L} / Z_{0}$ is shown in the graph in Fig. 2g. Output voltage is less than input voltage, as was the case for the buck converter.\n",
