    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern control schemes for high-performance drives, for example Field Oriented Control (FOC) or Direct Torque Control (DTC) are based on precise knowledge of some physical quantities that are hard to measure or are immeasurable in standard machines, the fluxes as pricipal example. Other quantities needed for control require additional transducers that are expensive in comparison to overall costs of the drive itsef, or can decrease reliability and compromise security in consecuence, when operated in hostile environment (speed encoders as example). \n",
    "\n",
    "As a collateral to the control schemes, there is also the need for the industry to offer a fault diagnosis prediction scheme in order to avoid compromised safety conditions in the operation of any industrial machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "A concept of self-sensing machine is emerging recently. Some researchers, see the future in machines that are actuators and sensors at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a vast variety of model-based solutions for induction motor speed estimation problem. Their efficacy depends mostly on accuracy of parameters identification. They can be divided into two main groups: open-loop observers (calculators) and closed-loop observers (\"predictors\"). The former ones are usually very sensitive to parameter variations whereas the latter ones are more robust thanks to presence of a correction loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These models demonstrates possibility to use a feedforward artificial neural network (ANN)(static neural network), or other regresion trained technique like,  to estimate (more precisely to approximate) mechanical speed of the induction motor, The supported vector machine (SVM) regression schemes have also been analyzed, to contrast them with regression technique within neural networks performing in. The main challenge in this task is to build an effective approach base.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: It should be noted that any estimation method that exploits only fundamental excitation (fundamental model) fails at zero stator flux frequency. The induction motor becomes an unobservable system at zero stator frequency. The proposed solutions also has this limitations. If control or predictive observation at zero frequency are required, other techniques have to be implemented. "

    "Synchronous motors have emerged as one of the most popular choices in industries and house hold due to their efficiency and high power ratings. However, for electric motors, a subtle change in the tolerance for any single part coforming the motor, will be reflected in an axys excetricity phenomena that in subtle steps over long times, will gradually change the output torque characterization, which is not a desirable feature and will results in degradation (by ageing) of the output efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless the change in torque also causes the current values to fluctuate which leads to power wastage and can even harm the motor and the dirivers, but also could be monitored by such trined machine learning and AI models, for be fainally used as fault diagnostic porpusses to avoid safety situations and keep control over machines for industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Industries and manufacturers are being continuously challenged by the increasing demand of need for the development of fault and control predictive models that can help industries to have a better control over machines and their applications. The traditional classical models, are often based on physical and mathematical modeling of system and need high expertise and in-depth understanding of system in order to develop control solutions. However, with swift advancements in methods like data mining and machine learning (Data Sciences), various techniques and algorithms have been developed which has revolutionized the fault diagnostics and control techniques for industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A trained machine learning model, with an effective algorithm, can help to automatically adjust the current and voltage for motor power drivers, in order to compensate the change in torque due for the day to day enviromental conditions (temperature, load, pression, ...) and also due stress accumulation over time in machines (all them single parts and materials), last reflected as ageing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best results for training of a machine learning based model was obtained by medium Gaussian for SVR and the usage of 3 leyered ANN perceptrons, being this last more affordable under the perspective of computational costs and reliability"
