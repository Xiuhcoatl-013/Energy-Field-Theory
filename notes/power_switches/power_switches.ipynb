    "The basic principles and characteristics of the main power switches are presented in this article. Semiconductor power devices are the center piece of the power electronics converters. While the knowledge about such devices is crucial to design a power converter with specific characteristics for a given application, the study of different topologies brings up new possibilities to improve the energy process system. As the objective is to furnish an overview of the different types of switches\n",

    "The design and construction of power semiconductor devices focus on how to improve their performance toward the hypothetical concept of an ideal switch. Figure 1. shows the power switches and the year of development of each switch. The performance of a given power switch is normally measured by its static and dynamic characteristics. An ideal switch must have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - I   Infinite blocking voltage capability\n",
    "   - II  No current while the switch is off\n",
    "   - III Infinite current capability when on\n",
    "   - IV  Drop voltage equal to zero while on\n",
    "   - V   No switching or conduction losses\n",
    "   - VI  Capability to operate at any switching frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to classify a power switch. For the purposes of this course, two different ways are considered: The static characteristics and The dynamic controllability. The main figures of merit for the static characteristics are the graphs describing the current versus voltage behaviors (I–V). On the other hand, for the dynamic features, the capability to change the states on and off through either an external signal (gating command) or by the variables of the circuit in which the switch is connected is considered. For example, there is no gating signal to turn on and off a diode, its conduction or blocking depends upon the voltage and current imposed by the circuit.\n",

    "## Static Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The static characteristics of the power semiconductor devices are related to their ability to either conduct or block one or two polarities, as shown in Fig. 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2(a) and 2(b) shows the ideal I–V characteristic for the blocking and conducting states, respectively. Figure 2(c)–2(g) depicts the voltage versus current (I–V) ideal characteristics for the main devices found in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The semiconductor devices can, therefore, operate with either unidirectional or bidirectional (UniC or BidC) current, and with either unidirectional or bidirectional voltage (UniV or BidV). For example: (i) diode, bipolar junction transistor (BJT), and insulated bipolar junction transistor (IGBT) are unidirectional voltage and current type of devices, (ii) SCR is an unidirectional current and bidirectional voltage device, (iii) TRIAC and bidirectional controlled thyristor (BCT) are bidirectional in current and voltage, and (iv) MOSFET is unidirectional in voltage and bidirectional in current.\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristics presented in Fig. 2(c)–2(g) play an important role for the specification and design of the power electronics converters. These graphs are in fact approximations of the real I–V characteristics of the device. For example, Fig. 2(c) is an approximation of the real characteristics of a power diode, which is presented later in this chapter.\n",

    "## Dynamic Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic characteristics of a specific device are related to the behavior of voltage and current when there is a change either from conduction to blocking state or from blocking to conduction. Such a change is known as commutation or switching. The commutation (or switching) from the blocking state to the conduction state is referred to as either turn-on or conduction. The commutation from the conduction state to the blocking state is referred to as either turn-off or blocking. For the I–V characteristic curves (shown in Fig. 2), the commutation process corresponds to going from the operating point on an axis to another one. For example, for a switch UniC/UniV with direct voltage as in Fig. 2(c), the blocking procedure makes the variables of the switch (voltage and current) go from the I-axis to the V-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the commutation process can be spontaneous or controlled, as shown in Fig. 3. Four cases are presented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Spontaneous conduction (SC)—see Fig. 3(a);\n",
    "    • Spontaneous blocking   (SB)—see Fig. 3(b);\n",
    "    • Controlled conduction  (CC)—see Fig. 3(c);\n",
    "    • Controlled blocking    (CB)—see Fig. 3(d).\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the case of spontaneous commutation (i.e., conduction and blocking), the change of state is defined by the variables of the power circuit, while for the controlled commutation, the change of state is guaranteed via a gating signal (command signal).\n",

    "Figure 4 shows the behavior of the voltage and current in time-domain (left side) and dynamic characteristics (right side) for SC, SB, CC, and CB. The points (P1, P2, and P3) along with the axes in Fig. 4 illustrate the behavior of the variables when the switching process occurs for both spontaneous and controlled commutation. For example, in Fig. 4(a) P1 indicates the operation point when the switch is blocked, which means that such a device is submitted to a negative voltage while its current is zero. The operation point P2 shows the device’s behavior while its voltage has been reduced. Finally, P3 shows the values of voltage and current when the switch is turned on. This commutation process occurs, for example, in a rectifier circuit with diodes where the circuit itself allows the state change from blocking to conduction. A similar analysis can be done for SB in Fig. 4(b). On the other hand, a controlled commutation device must have a control electrode,\n",
    "usually called a gate or base, in addition to the two main terminals. A control signal applied to the gate or base, while the voltage applied between the main terminals is positive, results in change of state in a desirable manner, that is, from one axis to another, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and 4(d).\n",

    "## Main Real Power Semiconductor Devices\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common power electronics devices are diodes, thyristors, and power transistors. Usually they have two power terminals (anode/cathode, or collector/emitter or drain/source) and one or more command terminals (gate/ base). Unlike the ideal characteristics presented earlier, real devices have practical limits for rated voltage and current, as well as for their operation frequency. Such limits are normally specified by the datasheet furnished by manufacturers. Therefore, the device characteristics and their specification are crucial to choose a particular power device instead of others.\n",

    "            \n",
    "* iii. $d v / d t$. It is the maximum variation rate of the forward voltage that can be applied to the device in the blocking state without starting a nonprogrammed turn-on.\n",
    "            \n",
    "* iv.  $d i / d t$. It is the maximum variation rate of the forward current during turn-on that can be applied to the device; higher $d i / d t$ than the one specified by the manufacturer may destroy the component.\n",

    "The conventional diode and the Schottky diode have the characteristic of SC and SB, as presented in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Conventional Diode\n",
    "The conventional diode is a silicon p–n junction device with two terminals, anode (A) and cathode (K), that conducts current from A to K and blocks the reverse current. The rating of the voltage goes up to 9 kV with 4.8 kA and 5 kV with 13 kA. Its symbol is presented in Fig.(a) and its real I–V characteristic is given in Fig.(b). The diode conducts when $v_{A K}>0$, the current being limited by the external circuit, its typical direct voltage drop is 0.7 V. Generally speaking, it can be said that they recover their reverse blocking capability when the forward current $i_{A}$ goes to zero and a reverse voltage is applied across its terminals, for an interval of time longer than the reverse recovery time $t_{rr}$ obtained in its technical data sheet. In reality, after reaching zero, the current reverses its direction, reaching a reverse peak called “peak reverse recovery current” that is comparable to the forward current. Snubber circuits are essential for the adequate protection of the diode. The snubber circuit will protect it from overvoltage spikes, mainly due to the junction capacitance and leakage\n",
    "inductance from terminals and circuit connections. The basic snubber circuit is composed of a capacitor in series with a resistor connected in parallel with the diode. The size of the snubber circuit is reduced for the fast ($t_{rr}$ < 1 μs) and ultrafast recovery diode ($t_{\\mathrm{rr}}$ < 100 ns), with ratings reaching: (i) 600 V, 30 A and $t_{rr}$ = 50 ns, and (ii) 1200 V, 120 A, $t_{\\mathrm{rr}}$ = 85 ns. Recent development in the silicon carbide material allows reducing the diode reverse recovery time up to 16 ns.\n",

    "#### The Schottky Diode\n",
    "Unlike the standard diode presented previously, the Schottky diode is formed by a metal-semiconductor junction (the p material is replaced by metal). It has a lower conduction drop voltage (typically 0.5 V) and faster switching time than the standard diode (less than 100 ps), which allows its operation in higher frequency. However, it has lower blocking voltage (typically up to 200 V) and higher leakage current. Its silicon carbide (SiC) version is promising and has been already tested to withstand 1.2 kV with 60 A."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The SCR \n",
    "The SCR is a silicon p–n–p–n device with three terminals: two power terminals, anode (A) and cathode (K) through which the current flows, and a control terminal, named the gate terminal (G). It is unidirectional in current and blocks in both forward and reverse directions (UniC/BidV). The device is triggered by a positive gate current pulse. When the gate is not triggered the SCR blocks the current in the forward direction even with $𝑣_{AK} > 0$. If $i_{GK} > 0$ while $𝑣_{AK} > 0$, the SCR conducts the current from anode to cathode imposed by the circuit in which the SCR is inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its voltage drop in conduction is from 1 to 4 V. Once in conduction, the SCR behaves like a diode and it can only be turned off when the anode current becomes zero. After the current reaches zero, a reverse voltage should be applied across its terminals in order to accelerate the capability of forward blocking. Note that the gate loses control over the SCR during its conduction. The symbol and real I–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 2.6(a) and 2.6(b), respectively. The direct and reverse voltages across its terminals are symmetrical in the conventional SCR (there are SCRs with asymmetrical voltage characteristics, the ASCR) and can reach 5 kV with 5 kA and 12 kV with 2.3 kA, or even 5 kV with 8 kA. Unexpected turn-on can occur due to a high $d𝑣∕dt$. For these reasons a snubber circuit with a capacitor can be used to avoid both triggering by $d𝑣∕dt$ and overvoltage spikes, a resistor that limits the current peak, and an inductor that limits the $di∕dt$ rate.\n",

It has two power terminals, T1 and T2, and one gate G. Its symbol and its I–V characteristic are presented in Fig. 2.7(a) and 2.7(b), respectively. When $𝑣_T = 𝑣_{T1} − 𝑣_{T2}$ is positive (quadrant I) and the TRIAC is turned on by a positive gate current pulse. But when the $𝑣_T$ is negative (quadrant III) it is turned on by a negative gate current pulse. The operation in quadrants II and IV is also possible but the gate triggering is less sensitive in these cases. Also, the $d𝑣∕dt$ is poorer than that of SCRs.\n",
    "Other CC/SB devices are the light-activated SCR (LASCR), the reverse conducting thyristor (RCT), which functions as an SCR with an inverse-parallel diode  (BidC/UniV), and the BCT, in which two SCRs are also connected in antiparallel, but differently from the TRIAC, each one acting independently with its independent gate control (BidC/BidV).\n",

The MOSFET acts as a resistance while conducting and behaves like a transistor before being turned on. Similar devices have been developed under different names, depending on the manufacturer, such as the HEXFET (“hexagonal-field-effect-transistor”), SIPMOS (“Siemens-Power Metal Oxide Silicon”) and TMOS (“T flowing current metal oxide silicon”). Its forward blocking voltage is in the range of 1 kV and it can operate in high frequency. Since it has an intrinsic diode in antiparallel connection, it operates with forward and reverse current and can be classified as a BidC/UniV device. It has replaced the BJT in the range of low voltage and high frequency but its disadvantage comes from its high conduction resistance that increases with the voltage.\n",

In IGCTs the cathode current is diverted to the gate before any distribution of current between gate and anode is observed so that the structure p–n–p–n can be converted to a p–n–p structure. As a result, the IGCT conducts as a GTO but turns off as an IGBT, combining the characteristics of these devices. Other parameters superior in the IGCT as compared to the GTO are the conduction\n",

The device has been applied in power system installations of 100 MVA and medium power (up to 5 MW) industrial drives. Like the GTO and IGCT, the reverse blocking IGCT (RBIGCT), symmetric, has been recently developed, and can withstand 5 kV."

    "#### The SIT \n",
    "The SIT, also known as Junction Field-Effect Transistor (J-FET), is an n-type field-effect transistor, voltage driven. Its symbol is given in Fig. 13(a). It is a UniC/UniV device with ratings of 1.2 kV and 300 A and can operate up to 100 kHz. \n",
    "It conducts when $𝑣_{GS} = 0$ and its drain current can be controlled by the gate-source voltage, $𝑣_{GS}$. However, the gate-source voltage required for turning off the device is high and it is not uncommon that a voltage as high as 40 V (negative) is needed. This characteristic of normally turned on with controlled turn-off classifies the device as SC/CB (the SIT normally-off has been already developed, with limited performance).\n",
    "However, its high forward voltage makes it unsuitable for most power electronics applications, unless radio frequency operation is needed. Additionally, the difficulty in manufacturing it raises concerns about its mass production. This device has been shown to be more promising with the SiC technology reaching ratings of 1.2 kV∕17 A and 6.5 kV∕5 A. Its range of power operation is up to 50 kW. It has been shown that a SiC SIT of 125 V∕2.2 kW can operate in the ultrahigh frequency range up to 450 MHz. However, the gate-source voltage required for turning this device off is about $V_{GS} = −30 V$. Although SiC SIT is a normally-on device, recently a SiC SIT normally-off has been developed with ratings of 1.2 kV and 35 A, with a turn-off VGS of only −2.5 V.\n",

    "#### The SITH \n",
    "The SITH, or SIThy, a device unidirectional in voltage, is a combination of an n-channel SIT and a p–n–p transistor. Its symbol is given in Fig. 2.13(b). It is a normally-on device with turn-off controlled by negative gate voltages and it does not have reverse blocking capability. It can handle currents in the range of 300 A to 2 kA with a recovery time from 2 to 4 μs and it is a device rated with 1.5 kV∕300 A and has a rated frequency of 10 kHz but it is expected to be applied to power sources up to 10 MHz. Although it can operate at higher frequencies compared to the GTO,\n",
    "its higher drop voltage and lower current gain are its main disadvantages. As for the SIT, the complexity of the manufacture process and the high negative gate voltage for turning it off are its major drawbacks."

    "The selection of a power device for a particular application depends not only on the required voltage and current levels but also on its switching characteristics.\n",

The BJT is a minority carrier device, whereas the MOSFET is a majority carrier device that does not have minority carrier storage delays, giving the MOSFET an advantage in switching speeds. BJT switching times may be a magnitude larger than those for the MOSFET. Therefore, the MOSFET generally has lower switching losses and is preferred over the BJT.\n",
