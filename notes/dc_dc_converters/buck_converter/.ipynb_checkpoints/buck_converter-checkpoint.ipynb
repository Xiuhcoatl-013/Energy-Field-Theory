    "## THE BUCK (STEP-DOWN) CONVERTER\n",
    "\n",
    "Controlling the dc component of a pulsed output voltage of the type in Fig. 06002c may be sufficient for some applications, such as controlling the speed of a dc motor, but often the objective is to produce an output that is purely dc. One way of obtaining a dc output from the circuit of Fig. 06002a is to insert a low-pass filter after the switch. Figure 06003a shows an $L C$ low-pass filter added to the basic converter. The diode provides a path for the inductor current when the switch is opened and is reverse-biased when the switch is closed. This circuit is called a buck comverter or a step-down comverter because the output voltage is less than the input.\n",

    "## Buck Converter Design Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Most buck converters are designed for continuous-current operation. The choice of switching frequency and inductance to give continuous current is given by [Eq. 06013], and the output voltage ripple is described by [Eq. 06016] and [Eq. 06021]. Note that as the switching frequency increases, the minimum size of the inductor to produce continuous current and the minimum size of the capacitor to limit output ripple both decrease. Therefore, high switching frequencies are desirable to reduce the size of both the inductor and the capacitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tradeoff for high switching frequencies is increased power loss in the switches. Increased power loss in the switches means that heat is produced. This decreases the converter's efficiency and may require a large heat sink, offsetting the reduction in size of the inductor and capacitor. Typical switching frequencies are above $20 \\mathrm{kHz}$ to avoid audio noise, and they extend well into the $100 \\mathrm{s}$ of kilohertz and into the megahertz range. Some designers consider about $500 \\mathrm{kHz}$ to be the best compromise between small component size and efficiency. Other designers prefer to use lower switching frequencies of about $50 \\mathrm{kHz}$ to keep switching losses small, while still others prefer frequencies larger than $1 \\mathrm{MHz}$. As switching devices improve, switching frequencies will increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "For low-voltage, high-current applications, the synchronous rectification scheme of Fig. 06007 is preferred over using a diode for the second switch. The voltage across the conducting MOSFET will be much less than that across a diode, resulting in lower losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inductor value should be larger than $L_{\\min }$ in [Eq. 06014] to ensure continuouscurrent operation. Some designers select a value 25 percent larger than $L_{\\min }$. Other designers use different criteria, such as setting the inductor current variation, $\\Delta i_{L}$ in [Eq. 06015], to a desired value, such as $40$ percent of the average inductor current. A smaller $\\Delta i_{L}$ results in lower peak and $\\mathrm{rms}$ inductor currents and a lower rms capacitor current but requires a larger inductor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inductor wire must be rated at the rms current, and the core should not saturate for peak inductor current. The capacitor must be selected to limit the output ripple to the design specifications, to withstand peak output voltage, and to carry the required rms current.\n",
    "\n",
    "The switch (usually a MOSFET with a low $R_{D S \\text { on }}$ ) and diode (or second MOSFET for synchronous rectification) must withstand maximum voltage stress when off and maximum current when on. The temperature ratings must not be exceeded, often requiring a heat sink.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming ideal switches and an ideal inductor in the initial design is usually reasonable. However, the ESR of the capacitor should be included because it typically gives a more significant output voltage ripple than the ideal device and greatly influences the choice of capacitor size."

    "## __Synchronous Rectification for the Buck Converter__\n",
    "Many buck converters use a second MOSFET in place of the diode. When $S_{2}$ is on and $S_{1}$ is off, current flows upward out of the drain of $S_{2}$. The advantage of this configuration is that the second MOSFET will have a much lower voltage drop across it compared to a diode, resulting in higher circuit efficiency. This is especially important in low-voltage, high-current applications. A Shottky diode would have a voltage of 0.3 to $0.4 \\mathrm{V}$ across it while conducting, whereas a MOSFET will have an extremely low voltage drop due to an $R_{D S_{\\mathrm{on}}}$ as low as single-digit milliohms. This circuit has a control scheme known as synchronous switching, or synchronous rectification. The second MOSFET is known as a synchronous rectifier. The two MOSFETs must not be on at the same time to prevent a short circuit across the source, so a \"dead time\" is built into the switching control one MOSFET is tumed off before the other is turned on. A diode is placed in parallel with the second MOSFET to provide a conducting path for inductor current during the dead time when both MOSFETs are off. This diode may be the MOSFET body diode, or it may be an extra diode, most likely a Shottky diode, for improved switching. The synchronous buck converter should be operated in the continuous-current mode because the MOSFET would allow the inductor current to go negative.\n",

    "## Interlived Buck Convertes\n",
    "\n",
    "Interleaving, also called multiphasing, is a technique that is useful for reducing the size of filter components. An interleaved buck converter is shown in Fig. 06017a. This is equivalent to a parallel combination of two sets of switches, diodes, and inductors connected to a common filter capacitor and load. The switches are operated $180^{\\circ}$ out of phase, producing inductor currents that are also $180^{\\circ}$ out of phase. The current entering the capacitor and load resistance is the sum of the inductor currents, which has a smaller peak-to-peak variation and a frequency twice as large as individual inductor currents. This results in a smaller peak-to-peak variation in capacitor current than would be achieved with a single buck converter, requiring less capacitance for the same output ripple voltage. The variation in current coming from the source is also reduced. Figure 06017b shows the current waveforms.\n",

    "## Switching Losses\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the on-state voltage drops and associated power losses of the switches, other losses occur in the switches as they turn on and off. Figure 06019a illustrates switch on-off transitions. For this case, it is assumed that the changes in voltage and current are linear and that the timing sequence is as shown. The instantaneous power dissipated in the switch is shown in Fig. 06019a. Another possible switch on-off transition is shown in Fig. 06012b. In this case, the voltage and current transitions do not occur simultaneously. This may be closer to actual switching situations, and switching power loss is larger for this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy loss in one switching transition is the area under the power curve. Since the average power is energy divided by the period, higher switching frequencies result in higher switching losses. One way to reduce switching losses is to modify the circuit to make switching occur at zero voltage and/or zero current. This is the approach of The Resonant Power Converter.\n",
