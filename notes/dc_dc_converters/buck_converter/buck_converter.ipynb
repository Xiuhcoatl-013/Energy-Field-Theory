    "\n",
    "Controlling the dc component of a pulsed output voltage of the type in Fig. 06002c may be sufficient for some applications, such as controlling the speed of a dc motor, but often the objective is to produce an output that is purely dc. One way of obtaining a dc output from the circuit of Fig. 06002a is to insert a low-pass filter after the switch. Figure 06003a shows an $L C$ low-pass filter added to the basic converter. The diode provides a path for the inductor current when the switch is opened and is reverse-biased when the switch is closed. This circuit is called a buck comverter or a step-down comverter because the output voltage is less than the input.\n",

    "__Synchronous Rectification for the Buck Converter__\n",
    "Many buck converters use a second MOSFET in place of the diode. When $S_{2}$ is on and $S_{1}$ is off, current flows upward out of the drain of $S_{2}$. The advantage of this configuration is that the second MOSFET will have a much lower voltage drop across it compared to a diode, resulting in higher circuit efficiency. This is especially important in low-voltage, high-current applications. A Shottky diode would have a voltage of 0.3 to $0.4 \\mathrm{V}$ across it while conducting, whereas a MOSFET will have an extremely low voltage drop due to an $R_{D S_{\\mathrm{on}}}$ as low as single-digit milliohms. This circuit has a control scheme known as synchronous switching, or synchronous rectification. The second MOSFET is known as a synchronous rectifier. The two MOSFETs must not be on at the same time to prevent a short circuit across the source, so a \"dead time\" is built into the switching control one MOSFET is tumed off before the other is turned on. A diode is placed in parallel with the second MOSFET to provide a conducting path for inductor current during the dead time when both MOSFETs are off. This diode may be the MOSFET body diode, or it may be an extra diode, most likely a Shottky diode, for improved switching. The synchronous buck converter should be operated in the continuous-current mode because the MOSFET would allow the inductor current to go negative.\n",
