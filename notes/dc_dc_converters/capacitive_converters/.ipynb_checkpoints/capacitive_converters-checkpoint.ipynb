    "# Switched Capacitor Converters\n",
    "\n",
    "In switched-capacitor converters, capacitors are charged in one circuit configuration and then reconnected in a different configuration, producing an output voltage different from the input. Switched-capacitor converters do not require an inductor and are also known as inductorless converters or charge pumps. Switched-capacitor converters are useful for applications that require small currents, usually less than 100 MA. Applications include use in $\\mathrm{RS}-232$ data signals that require both positive and negative voltages for logic levels; in flash memory circuits, where large voltages are needed to erase stored information; and in drivers for LEDs and LCD displays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic types of switched-capacitor converters are the step-up (boost), the inverting, and the step-down (buck) circuits. The following discussion introduces the concepts of switched-capacitor converters."

    "__The Step-Up Switched-Capacitor Converter__\n",
    "A common application of a switched-capacitor converter is the step-up (boost) converter. The basic principle is shown in Fig. 06024a. A capacitor is first connected across the source to charge it to $V_{s}$. The charged capacitor is then connected in series with the source, producing an output voltage of $2 V_{s^{*}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "A switching scheme to accomplish this is shown in Fig. 06024b. The switch pair labeled 1 is closed and opened in a phase sequence opposite to that of switch pair 2. Switch pair 1 closes to charge the capacitor and then opens. Switch pair 2 then closes to produce an output of $2 V_{s^{*}}$\n",

    "The switches can be implemented with transistors, or they can be implemented with transistors and diodes, as shown in Fig. 06024c.

The capacitor $C_{2}$ on the output is required to sustain the output voltage and to supply load current when $C_{1}$ is disconnected from the load. With $C_{2}$ included, it will take several switching cycles to charge it and achieve the final output voltage. With the resistor connected, current will flow from the capacitors, but the output voltage will be largely unaffected if the switching frequency is sufficiently high and capacitor charges are replenished in short time intervals. The output will be less than $2 V_{s}$ for real devices because of voltage drops in the circuit.\n",

    "Converters can be made to step up the input voltage to values greater than $2 V_{s}$. In Fig. 06025a, two capacitors are charged and then reconnected to create a voltage of $3 V_{s} .$ A switching arrangement to implement this circuit is shown in Fig. 06025b.
