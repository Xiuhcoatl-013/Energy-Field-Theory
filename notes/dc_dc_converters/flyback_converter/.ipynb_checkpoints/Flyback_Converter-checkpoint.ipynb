    "When the switch is closed in the flyback converter of Fig. 07002a, the source voltage is across the transformer magnetizing inductance $L_{m}$ and causes $i_{L_{m}}$ to increase linearly. Also while the switch is closed, the diode on the output is reverse-biased, and load current is supplied by the output capacitor. When the switch is open, energy stored in the magnetizing inductance is transferred through the transformer to the output, forward-biasing the diode and supplying current to the load and to the output capacitor.
