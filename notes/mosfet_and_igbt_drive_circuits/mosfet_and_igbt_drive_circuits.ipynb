    "Inductors and capacitors must be energized and deenergized in several applications of power electronics. For example, a fuel injector solenoid in an automobile is energized for a set time interval by a transistor switch. Energy is stored in the solenoid's inductance when current is established. The circuit must be designed to remove the stored energy in the inductor while preventing damage to the transistor when it is turned off. Circuit efficiency can be improved if stored energy can be transferred to the load or to the source rather than dissipated in circuit resistance. The concept of recovering stored energy is illustrated by the circuits described in this section.\n",

    "The MOSFET is a voltage-controlled device and is relatively simple to turn on and off, which gives it an advantage over a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). The on state is achieved when the gate-to-source voltage sufficiently exceeds the threshold voltage, forcing the MOSFET into the triode (also called ohmic or nonsaturation)region of operation. Typically, the MOSFET gate-to-source voltage for the on state in switching circuits is between $10$ and $20 V$, although some MOSFETs are designed for logic-level control voltages. The off state is achieved by a lower-than-threshold voltage. On- and off-state gate currents are essentially zero. However, the parasitic input capacitance must be charged to turn the MOSFET on and must be discharged to turn it off. Switching speeds are basically determined by how rapidly charge can be transferred to and from the gate.\n",

This is controlled by preventing $v_{CE}$ from going too low. However, on-state conduction losses for the BJT are larger than if the transistor were further into saturation where the collector-to-emitter voltage is lower.\n",
