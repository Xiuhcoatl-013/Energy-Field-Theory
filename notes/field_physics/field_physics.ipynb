    "## Introdcution\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics, a field means that a physical quantity is assigned to every point in space (or, more generally, space-time). A field is seen as extending throughout a large region of space so that it influences everything. The strength of a field usually varies over a region. Some literature refers to Michael Faraday as became the first to coin the term \"field\", in 1849.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some fields, there is a number for each point in space. They are called _scalar fields_. For example, on a weather map, the surface temperature is described by assigning a real number to each point on a map; the temperature can be considered at a fixed point in time or over some time interval, to study the dynamics of temperature change. Other examples are temperature fields or air pressure fields, which are often illustrated on weather reports by isotherms and isobars by joining up the points of equal temperature or pressure respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more complicated fields, there are more than one number for each point in space, for which could be formed a column, row or rectangular numbers array. They are called in general _vector fields_ [1](). For example, one can model a gravitational field by a vector field where a vector indicates the acceleration a mass would experience at each point in space. For instance, the electric field and the full description of electrodynamics are another examples of vector fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modern framework of the quantum theory of fields, even without referring to a \"test particle\", a field occupies space, contains [__energy__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) [2](), and its presence precludes a classical _\"true vacuum\"_. This has led physicists to consider electromagnetic fields to be a physical entity, making the field concept a supporting paradigm of the edifice of modern physics. The fact that the electromagnetic field can possess momentum and energy makes it very real ... a \"particle\" makes a field, and a field acts on another \"particle\", and the field has such familiar properties as energy content and momentum, just as \"particles\" can have. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the strength of most fields has been found to diminish with distance to the point of being undetectable. For instance the strength of many relevant classical fields, such as the gravitational field in Newton's theory of gravity or the electrostatic field in classical electromagnetism, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source (i.e., they follow [Gauss's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law)). One consequence is that the Earth's gravitational field quickly becomes undetectable on cosmic scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, a field can be classified as a scalar field or a vector field, according to whether the represented physical quantity is a scalar or a vector respectively. A field then, has a unique character in every point where it is defined: i.e. a field cannot be a scalar field somewhere and a vector field somewhere else. Moreover, within each category (scalar, vector), a field can be either a classical field or a quantum field, depending on whether it is characterized by numbers or quantum operators respectively. In fact in this theory an equivalent representation of field is a [field particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_carrier), namely a [\"boson\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson), but a field at the end.\n",

    "It is so common for the physicists's wordiness to refer some specific kind of vector's as a \"tensor\" or even a \"spinor\" and who knows what more, just for obfuscation maybe. However, at the end, such things still resembling the same vector concept, considering a vector (or matrix) as an array of numbers considering whatever possible configuration, for example: row, column, rectangular, cubic and else ..., and going beyond, why not an hexagon or a dodecahedron perhaps, just allow the mind itself to imagine another exotic number arrangements types, in general denoted as [ragged matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_matrix).

    "It is now believed that [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) should underlie all physical phenomena, so that a classical field theory should, at least in principle, permit a recasting in quantum mechanical terms; success yields the corresponding [quantum field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory) theory. For example, quantizing classical electrodynamics gives [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics). Quantum electrodynamics is arguably the most successful scientific theory; experimental data confirm its predictions to a higher precision (to more significant digits) than [any other theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_tests_of_QED).

    "As above with classical fields, it is possible to approach their quantum counterparts from a purely mathematical view using similar techniques as before.

A possible problem is that these RWEs can deal with complicated [mathematical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object) with exotic algebraic properties (for example, as ridiculous it seams, spinors are not tensors, but both of them concibed by physicists at the end, so they may need a special calculus type for spinor fields, and a barely different special calculus type for tensor fields, WTF!!!), but these in theory can still be subjected to analytical methods given appropriate [mathematical generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization), such this simple as it is (rejecting then the so-typical unrrational complications established by physicists, with such bunch of crap named \"spinors\" and \"tensors\")."

    "A field theory is a physical theory that describes how one or more physical fields interact with matter (other fields).\n",
    "\n",
    "Field theory usually refers to a construction of the dynamics of a field, it is, a specification of how a field changes with time or with respect to other independent physical variables on which the field depends. Usually this is done by writing a [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_(field_theory)) or a [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics) of the field, and treating it as a classical or quantum mechanical system with an infinite number of [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry)). The resulting field theories are referred to as classical or quantum field theories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamics of a classical field are usually specified by the [Lagrangian density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_(field_theory)) in terms of the field components; the dynamics can be obtained by using the action principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to construct simple fields without any prior knowledge of physics using only mathematics from [several variable calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus), [potential theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_theory) and [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation) (PDEs). For example, scalar PDEs might consider quantities such as amplitude, density and pressure fields for the wave equation and [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics); temperature/concentration fields for the [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation)/[diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_equation) equations. Outside of physics proper (for example, radiometry and computer graphics), there are even [light fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_field). All these previous examples are [scalar fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field). Similarly for vectors, there are vector PDEs for displacement, velocity and [vorticity fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field) in (applied mathematical) fluid dynamics, but vector calculus may now be needed in addition, being calculus for vector fields (as are these three quantities, and those for vector PDEs in general). More generally problems in [continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics) may involve for example, directional [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law#Hooke's_law_for_continuous_media) (from which it surely comes such term of tensor, commonly used by physicists, and derived from the Latin word for stretch), [complex fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_fluid) flows or [anisotropic diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropic_diffusion), which are framed as matrix PDEs, and then require matrices fields, hence in general [matrix calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_calculus). The scalars (and hence the vectors and matrices) can be real or [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) as both are [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)) in the abstract-algebraic/[ring-theoretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_theory) sense.\n",
