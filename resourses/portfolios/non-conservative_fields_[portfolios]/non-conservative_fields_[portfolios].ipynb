    "Calculate what the relative readings of $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ are for the diagram below. Notice that the wire that was connecting the left voltmeter with the D-side in the diagram on [Figure 1 - Non-Conservative Fields [In Circuit]](https://github.com/Xiuhcoatl-013/Energy-Field-Theory/blob/master/notes/non-conservative_fields/non-conservative_fields.ipynb), now is again connected with the $\\mathrm{D-side}$, but it is wrapped once around the whole circuit. The small are in the wire above $R_{1}$ indicates that it is not in contact with the horizontal wire with which it appears to intersect due to the 2-dimensional projection. To stress this further it has interrupted the horizontal wire a trifle on either side of the arc. This interruption is not real (it is not refer to a spark-gap or something similar); the horizontal wire is just continuous.\n",
