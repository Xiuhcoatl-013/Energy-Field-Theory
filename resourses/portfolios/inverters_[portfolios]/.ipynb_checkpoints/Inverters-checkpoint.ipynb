    "## Introduction\n",
    "Inverters are circuits that convert dc to ac. More precisely, inverters transfer power from a dc source to an ac load. From applications point of view, the objective is to create an ac voltage when only a dc voltage source is available. Inverters are used in applications such as adjustable-speed ac motor drives, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), and running ac appliances from an automobile battery."

    "## The Full-Bridge Converter\n",
    "The full-bridge converter of Fig 08001a is the basic circuit used to convert dc to ac. The full-bridge converter was introduced as part of a dc power supply circuit. In this application, an ac output is synthesized from a dc input by closing and opening the switches in an appropriate sequence. The output voltage $v_{o}$ can be $+V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$, $-V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$, or zero, depending on which switches are closed. Figure 08001b to 1e shows the equivalent circuits for switch combinations.\n",

    "## PWM Definitions and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, some definitions and considerations relevant when using PWM\n",
    "should be stated.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Frequency modulation ratio $m_{f}$. \n",
    "The Fourier series of the PWM output voltage has a fundamental frequency which is the same as the reference signal. Harmonic frequencies exist at and around multiples of the switching frequency. The magnitudes of some harmonics are quite large, sometimes larger than the fundamental. However, because these harmonics are located at high frequencies, a simple low-pass filter can be quite effective in removing them. Details of the harmonics in PWM are given in the next section. The frequency modulation ratio $m_{f}$ is defined as the ratio of the frequencies of the carrier and reference signals,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m_{f}=\\frac{f_{\\text {carricr }}}{f_{\\text {reference }}}=\\frac{f_{\\text {tri }}}{f_{\\text {sinc }}}\n",
    "$$   [Eq. 08035]\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the carrier frequency (increasing $m_{f}$) increases the frequencies at which the harmonics occur. A disadvantage of high switching frequencies is higher losses in the switches used to implement the inverter.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Amplitude modulation ratio $m_{a^{*}}$. \n",
    "The amplitude modulation ratio $m_{a^{*}}$ is defined as the ratio of the amplitudes of the reference and carrier signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m_{a}=\\frac{V_{m, \\text { reference }}}{V_{m, \\text { carrier }}}=\\frac{V_{m, \\text { sine }}}{V_{m, \\text { tri }}}\n",
    "$$   [Eq. 08036]\n",
    "\n",
    "If $m_{a} \\leq 1$, the amplitude of the fundamental frequency of the output\n",
    "voltage $V_{1}$ is linearly proportional to $m_{a}$. That is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{1}=m_{a} V_{\\mathrm{dc}}\n",
    "$$   [Eq. 08037]\n",
    "\n",
    "The amplitude of the fundamental frequency of the PWM output is thus\n",
    "controlled by $m_{a^{*}}$. This is significant in the case of an unregulated dc supply voltage because the value of $m_{a^{*}}$ can be adjusted to compensate for variations in the dc supply voltage, producing a constant-amplitude output. Alternatively, $m_{a^{*}}$ can be varied to change the amplitude of the output. If ma is greater than 1, the amplitude of the output increases with $m_{a^{*}}$, but not linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Switches. \n",
    "The switches in the full-bridge circuit must be capable of carrying current in either direction for pulse-width modulation just as they did for square wave operation. Feedback diodes across the switching devices are necessary, as was done in the inverter in Fig. 3a. Another consequence of real switches is that they do not turn on or off instantly. Therefore, it is necessary to allow for switching times in the control of the switches just as it was for the square-wave inverter.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Reference voltage. \n",
    "The sinusoidal reference voltage must be generated within the control circuit of the inverter or taken from an outside reference. It may seem as though the function of the inverter bridge is unnecessary because a sinusoidal voltage must be present before the bridge can operate to produce a sinusoidal output. However, there is very little power required from the reference signal [it could be implemented with a simple oscillator topology]. The power supplied to the load is provided by the dc power source, and this is the intended purpose of the inverter. The reference signal is not restricted to a sinusoid, and other waveshapes can function as the reference signal."

    "In the two-source inverter of Fig. 08009 using the switching scheme of Fig. 08010, the source and $\\mathrm{H}$ bridge producing the voltage $v_{1}$ supplies more average power (and energy) than the source and $\\mathrm{H}$ bridge producing $v_{2}$ due to longer pulse widths in both the positive and negative half cycles.

A PWM audio amplifier is referred to as a class $D$ amplifier. The triangular wave carrier signal for this application is typically $250 \\mathrm{kHz}$ to provide adequate sampling, and the PWM waveform is low-pass filtered to recover the audio signal and deliver power to a speaker. The spectrum of the PWM output signal is dynamic in this case.\n",

The class AB amplifier, the traditional circuit for audio applications, has a maximum theoretical efficiency of 78.5 percent for a sine wave of maximum undistorted output. In practice, with real audio signals, class $\\mathrm{AB}$ efficiency is much lower, on the order of 20 percent. The theoretical efficiency of the class $D$ amplifier is 100 percent because the transistors are used as switches. Because transistor switching and filtering are imperfect, practical class $\\mathrm{D}$ amplifiers are about 75 percent efficient.\n",

    "The PWM inverter is useful in a constant volts/hertz application because the amplitude of the output voltage can be adjusted by changing the amplitude modulation ratio $m_{a}$. The dc input to the inverter can come from an uncontrolled source in this case. The configuration in Fig. 08034 is classified as an ac-ac converter with a dc link between the two ac voltages.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The full- or half-bridge converters can be used to synthesize an ac output from a de input. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A simple switching scheme produces a square wave voltage output, which has a Fourier series that contains the odd harmonic frequencies of amplitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{n}=\\frac{4 V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{n \\pi}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amplitude and harmonic control can be implemented by allowing a zero-voltage interval of angle $\\alpha$ at each end of a pulse, resulting in Fourier coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{n}=\\left(\\frac{4 V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{n \\pi}\\right) \\cos (n \\alpha)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multilevel inverters use more than one dc voltage source or split a single voltage source with a capacitor voltage divider to produce multiple voltage levels on the output of an inverter. Pulse-width modulation (PWM) provides amplitude control of the fundamental output frequency. Although the harmonics have large amplitudes, they occur at high frequencies and are filtered easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Class D audio amplifiers use PWM techniques for high efficiency. The six-step inverter is the basic switching scheme for producing a three-phase ac output from a dc source. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A PWM switching scheme can be used with a three-phase inverter to reduce the THD of the load current with modest filtering. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Speed control of induction motors is a primary application of three-phase inverters."
